WebClient Technology Sample 
===========================
     This sample demonstrates how to use the WebClient type to connect to an FTP server and perform common operations,
     such as the upload or download of files or data.


Sample Language Implementations 
===============================
     This sample is available in the following language implementations:
     C#,VB


To build the sample using the Command Prompt 
============================================
     1. Open an SDK Command Prompt window and navigate to one of the language-specific subdirectories under the WebClientSample directory.

     2. Type msbuild.exe WebClientSample<lang>.sln at the command line where <lang> is either CS or VB.


To build the sample using Visual Studio 
=======================================
     1. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to one of the language-specific subdirectories under the WebClientSample directory.

     2. Double-click the icon for the .sln (solution) file to open the file in Visual Studio.

     3. On the Build menu, click Build Solution. 

     The application is built in the default \bin\Debug directory.


To run the sample 
=================
     1. Navigate to the directory that contains the new executable, using the command prompt or Windows Explorer.

     2. Type WebClientSample.exe at the command line. 

     Note: The sample builds a console application. You must launch and run it from the Command Prompt window to view its output.


Remarks 
=======
     The sample assumes that the FTP server uses anonymous authentication. If you supply the name of a server that 
     uses a different means of authentication, the requested upload or download fails. The sample also requires relative 
     path information. Full paths are not supported.
